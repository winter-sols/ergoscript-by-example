## How To Contribute

If you are interested in contributing your own example smart contacts
we'd be happy to include it in this repo.

All examples submitted must:
- Use the `Ergo Playground` via Scastie ([basic template here](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/Uylafp7eQFyrIZdlvtdM0g))
- Create a test scenario to show off the off-chain logic required for the contract to work
- Provide clear comments inside of the example about what the majority of the lines of code are doing
- Follow the [example template](example_template.md). (Ensure you include your scastie Ergo Playground url in both links)
- Has an understandable title/filename

Simply create a PR with your new `exampleTitle.md` file added to the repo + this `README.md` updated with your example added to the list of [ErgoScript Examples](#Ergoscript-examples).
