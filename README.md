## How To Contribute

We are always happy to include new high-quality examples within this repo if you are interested in contributing.

All examples submitted must:
- Use the `Ergo Playground` via Scastie ([basic template here](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/Uylafp7eQFyrIZdlvtdM0g))
- Create a test scenario to show off the off-chain logic required for the contract to work
- Provide clear comments inside of the code explaining what is going on
- Follow the [example template](example_template.md). (Ensure you include your scastie Ergo Playground url in both links)
- Have an understandable/relevant title + filename

Simply create a PR with your new `exampleTitle.md` file added to the repo + this `README.md` updated with your example added to the list of [ErgoScript Examples](#Ergoscript-examples).

If you are unsure about anything feel free to reference the [first example contract](pinLockContract.md) and/or join the [Ergo Discord](https://discord.gg/kj7s7nb) to ask questions.
